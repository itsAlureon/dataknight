    <h1>Privacy Policy for DataKnight - Privacy Guardian</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 15, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>DataKnight does NOT collect any personal data. The extension operates entirely locally and only processes data to protect your privacy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blocking Statistics:</strong> Local counts of blocked trackers, ads, cookies, and malicious scripts</li>
        <li><strong>Extension Settings:</strong> Your protection preferences and pause states</li>
        <li><strong>Gaming Data:</strong> Your level, XP, and achievement progress for the gamification features</li>
        <li><strong>Filter Lists:</strong> Downloaded privacy filter rules (EasyList, EasyPrivacy, Fanboy's Cookie Blocker) stored locally</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. DataKnight never transmits any data to external servers or third parties. Your privacy statistics and settings remain entirely on your computer.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>Locally stored data is used solely for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Displaying your privacy protection statistics and gaming progress</li>
        <li>Maintaining extension settings and preferences</li>
        <li>Blocking trackers, ads, and privacy threats across websites</li>
        <li>Providing site-specific security grades and threat assessments</li>
        <li>Updating privacy filter lists to improve protection</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What DataKnight Actually Protects</h2>
    <p>DataKnight is designed to PREVENT data collection by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blocking tracking scripts from Google Analytics, Facebook, Twitter, and other trackers</li>
        <li>Preventing tracking cookies from being set</li>
        <li>Stopping advertising networks from profiling you</li>
        <li>Blocking cryptocurrency mining scripts</li>
        <li>Adding privacy headers (Do Not Track, Global Privacy Control) to your requests</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Filter List Updates</h2>
    <p>DataKnight periodically downloads updated privacy filter lists from trusted sources (EasyList.to, Fanboy) to improve protection. These downloads contain only text-based blocking rules, not executable code, and no personal data is sent in these requests.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can reset all statistics and settings at any time through the extension's settings page. Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data. Since no data is collected externally, there is nothing to delete from external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, sell, share, or transfer any user data to third parties. DataKnight operates as a local privacy protection tool with no external data transmission.</p>
    
    <h2>Permissions Explanation</h2>
    <p>DataKnight requires broad permissions to function as a privacy protection extension:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access to all websites:</strong> Required to block trackers and ads across the entire web</li>
        <li><strong>Web requests:</strong> Needed to detect and block tracking requests in real-time</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Used only for local statistics and settings storage</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Required to block and remove tracking cookies</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions about this privacy policy, contact: vyasg091@gmail.com</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>Any changes to this privacy policy will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above. DataKnight's core principle of local-only operation and zero data collection will not change.</p>
